# Deep playground

The idea is to save ```epoch```, ```trainloss``` and ```testloss``` values so that we can compare different set of parameters in our model.

You can start learning process, at some point press "Reset" button and you'll be asked to download the CSV file

## Development

To run the visualization locally, run:
- `npm i` to install dependencies
- `npm run build` to compile the app and place it in the `dist/` directory
- `npm run serve` to serve from the `dist/` directory and open a page on your browser.

For a fast edit-refresh cycle when developing run `npm run serve-watch`.
This will start an http server and automatically re-compile the TypeScript,
HTML and CSS files whenever they change.
